\section*{TODO for Philipp}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finish the derivation of the \emph{outer solution }of tearing modes
for the cylinder as in Heyn08 started in \emph{Solution in cylinder

\item Think of a way to keep the splitting of field equations and plasma
response equations everywhere in the way described in the introduction.
What about Ohm's law and what happens with finite velocity and resistivity?
\item Try to find out what requires only flux coordinates, such as the pressure

the numerical code has converged.
\item Study the basics of non-linear ideal MHD equilibria codes VMEC/GVEC

\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of MHD treatment
of tokamaks with non-axisymmetric perturbations by analytical and
numerical methods. The methods can roughly be divided into linear,
non-linear and ideal and resistive treatment with or without flow.
We will explore features and limitations of each model and produce
analytical formulas to test numerical codes in limiting cases. For
the final result, this will only be possible in the cylindrical approximation
of the torus, where poloidal modes are uncoupled. However, some intermediate
results may be computed in straight-field line flux coordinates.

Most generally fields $\v E,\v B$ and charges/current (source) densities
$\rho,\v J$ have to fulfill \emph{field equations }
\begin{align}
\v E & =\hat{\v E}[\rho,\v J],\\
\v B & =\hat{\v B}[\rho,\v J],
\end{align}
yielding fields from given source densities and \emph{plasma response
equations}
\begin{align}
\rho & =\hat{\rho}[\v E,\v B],\\
\v J & =\hat{\v J}[\v E,\v B],
\end{align}
yielding source densities from given fields. Here symbols with a ``$\hat{}$''
denote solution operators to the governing (differential/integral)
equations.

In plasma equilibria one is usually not interested in very high-frequency
electromagnetic waves, so one neglects displacement currents and uses
at most a reduced form of Maxwell's equations in vacuum as field equations.
If $\rho$ and $\v J$ are given, they uniquely yield $\v E$ and
$\v B$. For the plasma response equations, one can employ the response
of a kinetic or magnetohydrodynamic model, ultimately boiling down
to single particles subject to Lorentz forces with some further assumptions/averaging.
If both, field and plasma response equations are simultaneously fulfilled,
i.e.
\begin{align}
\v E & =\hat{\v E}[\hat{\rho}[\v E,\v B],\hat{\v J}[\v E,\v B]],\\
\v B & =\hat{\v B}[\hat{\rho}[\v E,\v B],\hat{\v J}[\v E,\v B]],
\end{align}
at a point in time we speak of a \emph{self-consistent }plasma state
or of an \emph{equilibrium} if this state is stationary (vanishing
time derivatives). If we have found some equilibrium configuration,
we can consider perturbations around this equilibrium. If this perturbation
is sufficiently small, we can limit ourselves to the linear order,
analyze stability by computing eigenvalues, or find a new\emph{ perturbed
equilibrium. }For perturbations too large to permit linear theory,
one can still use the original equilibrium as a starting point of
a non-linear calculation of the final result.

In particular for a tokamak, the original equilibrium is axisymmetric,
so fully determined by two-dimensional quantities in the poloidal
plane. Up to the separatrix, such a 2D equilibrium contains of nested
flux surfaces around the magnetic axis (see e.g. d'haeseleer) and
can be computed by solving the Grad-Shafranov equation fitted to experimental
diagnostics. If a non-axisymmetric perturbation is applied, this property
is lost, but not everywhere (see KAM theory for details). The most
unstable flux surfaces that break up first are low-order \emph{rational
surfaces} that are called \emph{resonant surfaces} if some component
of the perturbation is aligned to them. This will become clear later
when we apply linear MHD in straight field-line flux coordinates (see
d'haeseleer). Away from these surfaces ideal MHD (no plasma resistivity)
remains valid. If resistive MHD is employed at these surfaces and
connected to ideal MHD outside, one obtains (linear) \emph{tearing
mode} theory, describing the formation of magnetic islands at resonant
surfaces (see Furth/Kileen/Rosenbluth and Heyn08).

One of the goals of this description is to revisit this theory with
less emphasis on the growth of tearing modes, but rather different
ways to ``cut out'' problematic parts and stitch them together,
allowing certain field components to jump across the resonant regions.
Traditionally such jumps were avoided, as it is not possible to solve
differential equations in their usual \emph{strong form} if discontinuous
quantities or derivatives are involved. If we however reformulate
them in their \emph{weak form} commonly used in finite element (Galerkin)
and finite volume methods, this problem is relaxed, and we gain results
that are still valid in \emph{integral form} with electric and magnetic
fluxes as well as total charges rather than charge densities. This
will allow us to find out which kind of jumps are allowed and which
are not within ideal MHD for the \emph{outer regions}, analogous to
refraction at boundaries where material parameters jump. Determining
size of the jumps will however require resistive or even kinetic treatment.

Some more hints: Rosenbluth (slab), Furth (cylinder) tearing modes.
Those are ``classical'' tearing modes as opposed to neoclassical
ones. Generally, such modes describe formation of magnetic islands,
where flux surfaces are ``torn apart''. Also: link to Alfven waves.
There singularity is resolved by finite electron mass but problem
is shifted to short-scale mode.

\section{Governing equations}

\paragraph{Resistive MHD equations}

(see Freidberg p. 9, beginning of Chap. 8 and for linear perturbations,
and problem 8.1 on p. 377 to change Ohm's law)

\begin{align}
\text{Mass:}\, & \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho\v v)=0\\
\text{Momentum:}\, & \rho\frac{\d\v v}{\d t}=\v J\times\v B-\nabla p\\
\text{Energy (adiabatic):}\, & \frac{\d}{\d t}\left(\frac{p}{\rho^{\gamma}}\right)=0\\
\text{Ohm's law:}\, & \v E+\v v\times\v B=\eta\v J\\
\text{Faraday:}\, & \nabla\times\v E=-\frac{\partial\v B}{\partial t}\\
\text{Ampère:}\, & \nabla\times\v B=\mu_{0}\v J\label{eq:ampere}\\
\text{divB:}\, & \nabla\cdot\v B=0
\end{align}
Here $\d/\d t=\partial/\partial t+\v v\cdot\nabla$. We have 14 unknowns:
$\rho,p,\v v,\v J,\v E,\v B$ for 17 equations (so many?). Parameters:
$\mu_{0}$ (fixed by the universe), adiabatic index $\gamma$, which
we usually set to $5/3$ (monoatomic ideal gas), and resistivity $\eta$
in Ohms which can be computed from the Spitzer resistivity (bottom
of p. 110 in Freidberg). Displacement currents neglected in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ampere}).
Gauss' law $\varepsilon_{0}\nabla\cdot\v E=n_{i}-n_{e}\approx0$ replaced
by quasineutrality condition $n_{i}=n_{e}$. Eq. (\ref{eq:ampere})

\paragraph{Ideal MHD equilibrium}

The usual starting point for further computations is the ideal MHD
equilibrium given by 

\begin{align}
\nabla p_{0} & =\v J_{0}\times\v B_{0}\\
\nabla\times\v B_{0} & =\mu_{0}\v J_{0}\\
\nabla\cdot\v B_{0} & =0
\end{align}
7 unknowns: $p,\v J,\v B$ for 7 equations.

\paragraph{Linear ideal MHD}

Applying a perturbation with functions $g=g_{0}+g_{1}$ and neglecting
flow $\boldsymbol{v}_{0}=\boldsymbol{v}_{1}=0$ yields

\begin{align}
\nabla p_{1} & =\v J_{0}\times\v B_{1}+\v J_{1}\times\v B_{0}\label{eq:plin}\\
\nabla\times\v B_{1} & =\mu_{0}\v J_{1}\\
\nabla\cdot\v B_{1} & =0
\end{align}

Here we subtracted zero-index versions of each equations to make them
disappear, e.g. $\nabla\times B_{0}=\mu_{0}\v J_{0}$ from Ampère's
law. Usually, we split the force balance from Maxwell's equation and
solve the two together iteratively (see Master's thesis of Patrick
Lainer).

\paragraph{Linear resistive MHD}

We apply a perturbation $\propto e^{-i\omega t}$ to our MHD equilibrium
and drop terms of second order. In the full resistive system this
means that
\begin{align}
\text{Mass:}\, & -i\omega\rho_{1}+\nabla\cdot(\rho_{0}\v v_{1}+\rho_{1}\boldsymbol{v}_{0})=0\\
\text{Momentum:}\, & -i\omega(\rho_{0}\v v_{1}+\rho_{1}\boldsymbol{v}_{0})=\v J_{0}\times\v B_{1}+\v J_{1}\times\v B_{0}-\nabla p_{1}\\
\text{Energy (adiabatic):}\, & p_{1}\rho_{0}-\gamma p_{0}\rho_{1}=0\\
\text{Ohm's law:}\, & \v E_{1}+\v v_{1}\times\v B_{0}+\boldsymbol{v}_{0}\times\boldsymbol{B}_{1}=\eta\v J_{1}\\
\text{Faraday:}\, & \nabla\times\v E_{1}=-i\omega\v B_{1}\\
\text{Ampère:}\, & \nabla\times\v B_{1}=\mu_{0}\v J_{1}\label{eq:ampere-1}\\
\text{divB:}\, & \nabla\cdot\v B_{1}=0
\end{align}
In the energy equation we have used a Taylor expansion in the perturbation
of $\rho$, and multiplied the equation by $\rho_{0}^{\gamma+1}/(i\omega)$.
Again we already subtracted zero-index versions of each equations. 

Expressing $\rho_{1}$ via the Energy law by
\[
\rho_{1}=\frac{p_{1}}{\gamma p_{0}}\rho_{0}
\]
and insertion into the Mass law yields
\[
-i\omega\frac{\rho_{0}}{\gamma p_{0}}p_{1}+\nabla\cdot(\rho_{0}\v v_{1}+\frac{p_{1}}{\gamma p_{0}}\rho_{0}\boldsymbol{v}_{0})=0,
\]
and in the Momentum law
\[
-i\omega(\rho_{0}\v v_{1}+\frac{\rho_{0}}{\gamma p_{0}}p_{1}\boldsymbol{v}_{0})=\v J_{0}\times\v B_{1}+\v J_{1}\times\v B_{0}-\nabla p_{1}.
\]
In the static case $\omega=0$, the equations reduce to linear ideal
MHD, as velocities don't appear in the Momentum equation anymore. 

\section{Trying to extend Patrick's thesis to resistive MHD (experimental)}

\paragraph{Splitting the problem without flow}

Part 1: Solve
\begin{align}
-i\omega\rho_{0}\v v_{1} & =\v J_{0}\times\v B_{1}+\v J_{1}\times\v B_{0}-\nabla p_{1}\\
-i\omega\rho_{0}p_{1} & =-\gamma p_{0}\nabla\cdot(\rho_{0}\v v_{1})\\
-i\omega\v B_{1} & =\nabla\times(\eta\v J_{1}-\v v_{1}\times\v B_{0})
\end{align}
for given $\v B_{1}$. 7 unknowns $p_{1},\v J_{1},\v v_{1}$ for 7
equations.

Part 2: Solve
\begin{align}
\nabla\times\v B_{1} & =\mu_{0}\v J_{1}\label{eq:ampere-1-1-1}\\
\nabla\cdot\v B_{1} & =0
\end{align}
for given $\v J_{1}$. 3 unknowns $\v B_{1}$ for 4 equations. 

\paragraph{Splitting the problem further}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Parallel momentum (pressure):
\begin{equation}
-i\omega(\rho_{0}v_{1\parallel})B_{0}=-\v B_{1}\cdot\nabla p_{0}-\v B_{0}\cdot\nabla p_{1}
\end{equation}
\item Perpendicular momentum (current):
\begin{equation}
-i\omega\rho_{0}\v h_{0}\times\v v_{1\perp}=\v B_{0}\times(\v J_{0}\times\v B_{1})+B_{0}\v J_{1}-\v B_{0}\times\nabla p_{1}
\end{equation}
\item Ohm+Faraday:
\begin{equation}
-i\omega\v B_{1}=\nabla\times(\eta\v J_{1}-\v v_{1\perp}\times\v B_{0})
\end{equation}
\item Mass+Adiabatic:
\begin{equation}
-i\omega\rho_{0}p_{1}=-\gamma p_{0}\nabla\cdot(\rho_{0}\v v_{1})
\end{equation}
Divergence
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot\v u & =\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{u_{\parallel}}{B_{0}}\v B_{0}+\v u_{\perp}\right)=\v B_{0}\cdot\nabla\left(\frac{u_{\parallel}}{B_{0}}\right)+\nabla\cdot\v u_{\perp}\\
\nabla\cdot(\rho_{0}\v v_{1}) & =\v B_{0}\cdot\nabla\left(\frac{\rho_{0}v_{1\parallel}}{B_{0}}\right)+\nabla\cdot(\rho_{0}\v v_{1\perp})
\end{align}
With the possibility to pull out $\rho_{0}$ if it is constant along
field lines $(\v B_{0}\cdot\nabla\rho_{0})$. 
\item Magnetostatics:
\begin{align}
\nabla\times\v B_{1} & =\mu_{0}\v J_{1}\label{eq:ampere-1-1-1-1}\\
\nabla\cdot\v B_{1} & =0
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
Steps of solution
\begin{enumerate}
\item solve parallel Momentum with given $\v B_{1},v_{1\parallel}$ $\Rightarrow p_{1}$
\item solve perpendicular Momentum with given $\v B_{1},\v v_{\perp},p_{1}\Rightarrow\v J_{1}$
\item solve Ohm+Faraday with Mass+Adiabatic with given $\v B_{1},p_{1},\v J_{1}\Rightarrow v_{1\parallel},\v v_{1\perp}$
\item solve Ampère with given $\v J_{1}$$\Rightarrow\v B_{1}$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Analytical treatment in flux/cylinder coordinates}

Here we derive linear equations for perturbed equilibria in a tokamak
based on an equilibrium (subscript 0). As in the numerical treatment
(see Patrick Lainer's thesis) it is sensible to proceed as following
\begin{enumerate}
\item Treat the MHD \emph{plasma response }for given fields
\begin{enumerate}
\item Express the pressure perturbation
\item Express the current perturbation
\end{enumerate}
\item Use Maxwell's equations and/or Ohm's law as \emph{field equations}
\item Put everything together in a single equation and possibly solve it
\end{enumerate}
We will use a \emph{Fourier expansion} in flux coordinates in the
axisymmetric equilibrium field $\v B_{0}$ to emphasize features and/or
find solutions to equations. At some point we have to simplify further
and resort to the \emph{cylinder approximation} where the curvature
of the torus is neglected and the axis of a periodic cylinder takes
the role of the magnetic axis in toroidal $\ph$-direction. This will
be needed to remove coupling of harmonics in the \emph{poloidal flux
angle} which becomes the cylinder azimuth angle in this limit. Be
careful not to mix this up with usual cylindrical coordinates which
use instead the \emph{toroidal angle} as the aximuth.

For practical information on flux coordinates, see d'haeseleer. The
most important features are that contravariant radial components of
$\v B_{0}$ and $\v J_{0}$ vanish, and that contravariant \emph{vector
density components }$\sqrt{g}B^{k}\equiv\mathcal{B}^{k}=\mathcal{B}^{k}(r)$
depend only on the radial variable, but not on the angles. For more
information on vector densities, see Wikipedia, the book \emph{Geometrical
Vectors}, or the slightly humorous rant \emph{CONTRAVARIANCE, COVARIANCE,
DENSITIES, AND ALL THAT}\textbf{\emph{ }}by Chris Tiee. While their
actual meaning is connected to differential forms, for us it is enough
to know that everything becomes nicer to write since $\sqrt{g}$ disappears
in most expressions, in particular in $\nabla\cdot\v B=0$ which becomes
$\partial_{i}\mathcal{B}^{i}=0$.

\paragraph{Solution in flux coordinates coordinates at zero frequency and/or
zero flow}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Plasma response
\begin{enumerate}
\item Parallel momentum (pressure). Project Eq.~(\ref{eq:plin}) onto $\v B_{0}$:\\
\begin{equation}
\v B_{0}\cdot\nabla p_{1}=\v B_{0}\cdot(\v J_{0}\times\v B_{1})=\v B_{1}\cdot(\v B_{0}\times\v J_{0})=-\v B_{1}\cdot\nabla p_{0}
\end{equation}
so\\
\begin{equation}
\v B_{0}(\boldsymbol{x})\cdot\nabla p_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})=-\v B_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})\cdot\nabla p_{0}(r)
\end{equation}
becomes (in flux coordinates $B_{0}^{r}=0$, so it vanishes on the
left-hand side) and $p_{0}=p_{0}(r)\Rightarrow\nabla p_{0}=p_{0}^{\prime}(r)\nabla r$
and $\v B_{1}\cdot\nabla r=B_{1}^{r}$ we get
\begin{equation}
B_{0}^{\tht}(\boldsymbol{x})\frac{\partial p_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial\tht}+B_{0}^{\ph}\frac{\partial p_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial\ph}=-B_{1}^{r}(\boldsymbol{x})p_{0}^{\prime}(r).
\end{equation}
Using vector density components $\sqrt{g}B^{k}\equiv\mathcal{B}^{k}$
with $\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\tht}=\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\tht}(r)$ and $\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\ph}=\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\ph}(r)=q\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\tht}(r)$
in flux coordinates for $\v B_{0}$ we have
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\tht}(r)\left(\frac{\partial p_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial\tht}+q(r)\frac{\partial p_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial\ph}\right)=-\mathcal{B}_{1}^{r}(\boldsymbol{x})p_{0}^{\prime}(r).
\end{equation}
Written in harmonic expansion in angles $\tht,\ph$ we have
\begin{equation}
i\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\tht}(r)\left(mp_{mn}(r)+nq(r)p_{mn}(r)\right)=-\mathcal{B}_{mn}^{r}(\boldsymbol{x})p_{0}^{\prime}(r)
\end{equation}
with the solution at each flux surface given by
\begin{equation}
p_{mn}(r)=i\frac{\mathcal{B}_{mn}^{r}(r)}{\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\tht}(r)}\,\frac{p_{0}^{\prime}(r)}{m+nq(r)}.\label{eq:pmn}
\end{equation}
Here we clearly see that at flux surfaces where $q(r)=-m/n$ the solution
diverges. 
\item For current:
\begin{equation}
\v J_{0}\times\v B_{1}+\v J_{1}\times\v B_{0}-\nabla p_{1}
\end{equation}
We have
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\v J_{0}=\partial_{i}\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\,i}=0
\end{equation}
so 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{r}\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\,r}+\partial_{\tht}\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\tht}+\partial_{\ph}\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\ph}=0.
\end{equation}
and since we have axisymmetry, $\partial_{\ph}$ vanishes, and in
flux coordinates $\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\,r}=0$. What remains is $\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\tht}$,
so 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{\tht}\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\tht}=0\Rightarrow\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\,\tht}=\sqrt{g}J_{0}^{\,\tht}=\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\,\tht}(r).
\end{equation}
In addition we have
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\,\tht}=\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\,\tht}(r),\quad\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\,\ph}=\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\,\ph}(r)
\end{equation}
due to flux coordinates. \textbf{For further derivations see section
in cylindrical coordinates. Most likely this can be extended to special
cases in flux coordinates with $\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\,\ph}=\mathcal{J}_{0}^{\,\ph}(r)$.
This is the case in Hamada coordinates, but not necessarily in symmetry
flux coordinates. One could start looking for conditions under which
symmetry flux coordinates coincide with Hamada coordinates for testing.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Momentum equation with flow in flux coordinates}

Adding a finite flow velocity $\v v$ results in the following equation,
\begin{equation}
-i\omega\rho_{0}(r)B_{0}(\boldsymbol{x})\left(v_{1\parallel}(\v x)+\frac{v_{0\parallel}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\gamma p_{0}(r)}p_{1}(\v x)\right)+\v B_{0}(\boldsymbol{x})\cdot\nabla p_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})=-\v B_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})\cdot\nabla p_{0}(r).
\end{equation}
Here $v_{0\parallel}=\v B_{0}\cdot\v v_{0}$ and $v_{1\parallel}=\v B_{0}\cdot\v v_{1}$.
Written in flux coordinates we obtain
\begin{equation}
-i\omega\rho_{0}(r)\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\tht}(r)\left(v_{1\tht}(\v x)+q(r)v_{1\ph}(\v x)+\frac{v_{0\tht}(\v x)+q(r)v_{0\ph}(\v x)}{\gamma p_{0}(r)}p_{1}(\v x)\right)+\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\tht}(r)\left(\frac{\partial p_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial\tht}+q(r)\frac{\partial p_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial\ph}\right)=-\mathcal{B}_{1}^{r}(\boldsymbol{x})p_{0}^{\prime}(r).
\end{equation}
In the general case of non-zero equilibrium flow $v_{0\parallel}(\boldsymbol{x})$
we cannot expand this in angles locally on a flux surface, as a non-linear
term appears in its product with $p_{1}(\v x)$. Assuming $v_{0\tht}=v_{0\tht}(r)$
and $v_{0\ph}=v_{0\ph}(r)$ we can still use this method and obtain
a radially local Fourier expansion (skipping dependencies on $r$
in notation) with
\begin{equation}
-i\omega\rho_{0}\left(v_{mn\,\tht}+qv_{mn\,\ph}+\frac{v_{0\tht}+qv_{0\ph}}{\gamma p_{0}}p_{mn}\right)+i\left(m+nq\right)p_{mn}=-\frac{p_{0}^{\prime}}{\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\tht}}B_{mn}^{r}.
\end{equation}
The solution in $p_{mn}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
p_{mn}=\frac{i\frac{p_{0}^{\prime}}{\mathcal{B}_{0}^{\tht}}B_{mn}^{r}+\omega\rho_{0}\left(v_{mn\,\tht}+qv_{mn\,\ph}\right)}{m+nq-\omega\frac{\rho_{0}}{\gamma p_{0}}(v_{0\tht}+qv_{0\ph})}.
\end{equation}
Here the introduction of $v_{0\parallel}$ just shifts the resonance
radially and cannot resolve it. Only if the numerator tends towards
zero faster than the numerator tends to infinity, a finite solution
can follow in this model.

\paragraph{Solution in cylinder coordinates coordinates at zero frequency and/or
zero flow}

First we are going to approximate our torus by a periodic cylinder.
Before, we had used a different kind of cylindrical coordinates $(R,\ph,Z)$
with the cylinder axis coinciding with Cartesian $Z$ axis in the
center of the torus. Now we take the $z$-axis as the distance along
the toroidal direction and define transformations
\begin{align}
R(r,\tht,z) & =R_{0}+r\cos\tht,\\
\ph(r,\tht,z) & =z/R_{0},\\
Z(r,\tht,z) & =r\sin\tht.
\end{align}
Non-vanishing derivatives are
\begin{align}
\partial_{r}R(r,\tht,z) & =\cos\tht,\\
\partial_{\tht}R(r,\tht,z) & =-r\sin\tht,\\
\\
\partial_{z}\ph(r,\tht,z) & =1/R_{0},\\
\\
\partial_{r}Z(r,\tht,z) & =\sin\tht,\\
\partial_{\tht}Z(r,\tht,z) & =r\cos\tht.
\end{align}
The metric tensor in original cylindrical coordinates was
\begin{equation}
g_{ij}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\\
 & R^{2}\\
 &  & 1
\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
The metric tensor in the new \textquotedbl toroidal cylinder coordinates\textquotedbl{}
are
\begin{equation}
\bar{g}_{ij}=\frac{\partial x^{a}}{\partial\bar{x}^{i}}\frac{\partial x^{b}}{\partial\bar{x}^{j}}g_{ab}.
\end{equation}
Thus with $\cos^{2}\tht+\sin^{2}\tht=1$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
\bar{g}_{ij}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\\
 & r^{2}\\
 &  & \frac{R^{2}}{R_{0}^{\,2}}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\\
 & r^{2}\\
 &  & (1+\frac{r}{R_{0}}\cos\tht)^{2}
\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
At large aspect ratios $r\ll R_{0}$ it follows that $\bar{g}_{zz}\approx1$
and our new coordinates behave as usual cylinder coordinates, but
with the topology of a torus, as $z$ closes on itself toroidally.
Taking this approximation we now work in physical, rather than covariant
components. Our unit basis vectors are
\begin{equation}
\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_{r}=\nabla r,\quad\hat{\v e}_{\tht}=r\nabla\tht,\quad\hat{\v e}_{z}=\nabla z.
\end{equation}
We model our magnetic field $\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$ and currents $\boldsymbol{J}_{0}$
winding around surfaces of $r=\text{const.}$ and physical components
depending only on $r$,
\begin{align}
\v B_{0} & =B_{0\tht}(r)\hat{\v e}_{\tht}+B_{0z}(r)\hat{\v e}_{z},\\
\v J_{0} & =J_{0\tht}(r)\hat{\v e}_{\tht}+B_{0z}(r)\hat{\v e}_{z}.
\end{align}
We can define the safety factor (TODO: check if this is correct) as
\begin{equation}
q(r)=\frac{B_{0z}(r)}{B_{0\tht}(r)}.
\end{equation}
Now we start with 
\begin{align}
\nabla p & =\frac{1}{c}\v J\times\boldsymbol{B},\\
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{B} & =0,\\
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{J} & =0.
\end{align}
The linear order equation is 
\begin{align}
\nabla p_{1} & =\frac{1}{c}(\v J_{0}\times\v B_{1}+\v J_{1}\times\v B_{0}),\\
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{B}_{1} & =0,\\
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{J}_{1} & =0.
\end{align}
Modeling quantities $p_{1},\boldsymbol{B}_{1}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}_{1}$
in wavenumber space on each flux surface as
\begin{equation}
f(r,\tht,z)=f_{\boldsymbol{k}}(r)e^{i\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{x}}=f(r)e^{i(k_{\tht}\tht+k_{z}z)}
\end{equation}
with $\v k=k_{\tht}\hat{\v e}_{\tht}+k_{z}\hat{\v e}_{z}$ there is
no product of two harmonics, as unperturbed quantities depend only
on $r$. So we can write independent equations for each $\boldsymbol{k}$
with
\begin{align}
p_{\boldsymbol{k}}^{\prime}(r)\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_{r}+i\boldsymbol{k}p_{\boldsymbol{k}}(r) & =\frac{1}{c}(\v J_{0}(r)\times\v B_{\boldsymbol{k}}(r)+\v J_{\boldsymbol{k}}(r)\times\v B_{0}(r)),\\
B_{\boldsymbol{k}r}^{\prime}(r)+i\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(r) & =0,\\
J_{\boldsymbol{k}r}^{\prime}(r)+i\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{J}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(r) & =0.
\end{align}
Here, vector quantities depending on $r$ mean that their components
in $(r,\tht,z)$ depend only on $r$, and primes mean radial derivatives.
Repeating the exercise from above we first take the parallel part
by a scalar product with $\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$
\begin{align}
i\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}_{0}p_{\boldsymbol{k}} & =\frac{1}{c}(\boldsymbol{B}_{0}\cdot(\v J_{0}\times\v B_{\boldsymbol{k}}))\nonumber \\
 & =-\boldsymbol{B}_{\boldsymbol{k}}\cdot\nabla p_{0}=-\frac{1}{c}B_{\boldsymbol{k}r}p_{0}^{\prime}.
\end{align}
This means that Eq.~(\ref{eq:pmn}) is represented by
\begin{equation}
p_{\boldsymbol{k}}=i\frac{B_{\boldsymbol{k}r}p_{0}^{\prime}}{\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}_{0}}.
\end{equation}
Resonance is obtained for $\boldsymbol{k}\parallel\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$.
\textbf{This is already one term inside Heyn08, Eq. (6), inside $F_{p}$.}

Now we look at Ampere's law for the perturbation with
\begin{equation}
\nabla\times\boldsymbol{B}_{1}=\frac{4\pi}{c}\boldsymbol{J}_{1}.
\end{equation}
Note that we don't assume it to be true for unperturbed quantities.
Then in $\boldsymbol{k}$-space
\begin{equation}
i\boldsymbol{k}\times\boldsymbol{B}_{\boldsymbol{k}}-B_{\boldsymbol{k}z}^{\prime}\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_{\tht}+B_{\boldsymbol{k}\tht}^{\prime}\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_{r}=\frac{4\pi}{c}\boldsymbol{J}_{\boldsymbol{k}}.
\end{equation}

\textbf{TODO: put everything together to obtain Heyn08, Eq. (6).}
